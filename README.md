# dummy-scripts

## Overview
These scripts for the command line create dummy lists.

## Background
This collection of scripts was done in order to create a csv file to upload dummy users to a moodle website.

Since I am new to ruby I might be using this project to make a better command line tool and put all files into one.

## Usage (for now)

`ruby userpass.rb AMOUNT LENGTH` -> Nu.XXXX (X is LENGTH)

["Nu." is the default prefix, changes to be made in the code]


`ruby usercreate.rb NAME AMOUNT` -> nameXX (X is running number)


`ruby emailcreate.rb NAME DOMAIN AMOUNT` nameXX @DOMAIN.com (X is running number)
